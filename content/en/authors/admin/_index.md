Hello! I am Seungjun Lee, and I am currently studying in the computer engineering department of Chonbuk National University. Currently, I am deeply interested in web development and communication fields. I think web development is an important field that provides convenience and new experiences through interaction with users, and communication technology plays a key role in strengthening communication between people. In the future, I want to grow into a web application developer or communication system engineer, develop innovative solutions that consider the convenience of users, and contribute to building a stable and fast communication network. My goal is to have a positive impact on society based on technical knowledge, and to always learn and grow in line with constantly changing technology trends.
