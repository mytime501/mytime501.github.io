React is used to implement the front end of a web application that visually provides users with random data provided at the back end. It receives randomly extracted data from the back end through API and renders it for users to see at the front end.


a major task

- Front-end development: Designed a user interface with React, and visually represented randomly extracted data.
- API Interworking: Random keywords and story data provided by the backend were imported through the API, processed and rendered by the front end.
- Health Management: Utilized React's health management capabilities to dynamically handle user interface behavior.
- UI/UX Improvement: Optimized interface design and visual representation of data considering user experience.
