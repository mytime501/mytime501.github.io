Project Overview

I was involved in a project to improve the communication efficiency of the military control system. The main objectives were to optimize control queries to eliminate unnecessary packet transmission and to improve system performance and responsiveness.

A major task

- Optimized control queries: Minimized network traffic by redesigning and optimizing control queries used in military control systems.
- Packet filtering: Implemented a strategy of identifying and eliminating unnecessary packets, ensuring that only essential data is transmitted. This increased the speed and reliability of communication between systems.
- Improve performance: Improve query efficiency to reduce latency and enhance real-time responsiveness to provide immediate control for mission performance.
- Collaboration: Working closely with network engineers to ensure system integration and optimal performance.

Performance

- It has significantly improved communication bandwidth by reducing unnecessary data transmission by 45%.
- It improves the system's real-time responsiveness, enabling quick decision-making and control.
- We have secured system stability and scalability to prepare for future upgrades and additional functional implementations.
