Project Overview
</div>

This project is a communication program between ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and computer numerical control (CNC) equipment developed with C#. The software transmits and receives data in real time, enabling accurate control of CNC machines and signal monitoring of ADC.


Key Features

- Real-time data transfer: Converts analog signals measured in ADC into digital data and transmits them to CNC equipment.
- Two-way communication: receive the status information of the CNC equipment in real time and perform additional control commands based on this.
- Error handling: Increased stability by implementing the ability to detect and handle errors that may occur in the communication process.


Tech Stack

- Programming Language: C#
- communication protocol: using the Focas1 protocol
- Development Environment: Visual Studio


Project Progress

- Planning and Design: Analyzed communication requirements between ADC and CNC, and designed the basic architecture of the program.
- Development: implemented ADC data collection and CNC control logic with C#. developed communication function by utilizing Focas1 library.
- Testing and debugging: The program was tested in various scenarios to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the data transfer, and to resolve the issues that arise.


Performance

- Accurate data communication: maintained data transfer success rate between ADC and CNC above 95%, increasing the stability of machine operation.
- User interface: Intuitive user interface allows users to easily monitor and control data.
- Documentation: Documenting the design and implementation process of the project, leaving useful materials for future maintenance and development.


Future plans

- Feature Extension: We plan to increase compatibility by adding support for various ADC and CNC models.
- Performance Optimization: We will study how to improve data transmission speed and minimize communication delays.
- Reflecting user feedback: We plan to carry out software improvement work based on feedback from real users.
