- UI Design: We designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface using WPF.
- Functional implementation: The basic four arithmetic operation function is implemented to display the calculation results in real time for the number entered by the user.
- Project Structure Management: Systematically managed the folder structure and files of the project to facilitate maintenance and expansion.


Technology of use

- Programming Language: C#
- Framework: .NET Framework
- UI Framework: WPF


Performance

- Based on user feedback, we designed an intuitive user interface to improve the user experience.
- By verifying the accuracy and efficiency of the computational function, we provided a reliable application.
- Utilizing the various functions of WPF, the design of the application has been improved in a modern and sophisticated manner.
